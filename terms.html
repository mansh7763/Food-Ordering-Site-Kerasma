          <h2>Accepting these Terms</h2>
          <p>
            If you access or use the Service, it means you agree to be bound by
            all of the terms below. So, before you use the Service, please read
            all of the terms. If you don't agree to all of the terms below,
            please do not use the Service. Also, if a term does not make sense
            to you, please let us know by e-mailing <a href="mailto:bt22csa051@iiitn.ac.in">Himanshu kumar</a>.

          <h2>Changes to these Terms</h2>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. For
            instance, we may need to change these Terms if we come out with a
            new feature or for some other reason. Whenever we make changes to
            these Terms, the changes are effective one week after we post such
            revised Terms (indicated by revising the date at the top of these
            Terms) or upon your acceptance if we provide a mechanism for your
            immediate acceptance of the revised Terms (such as a click-through
            confirmation or acceptance button). It is your responsibility to
            check Kerasma for changes to these Terms. If you continue to use the
            Service after the revised Terms go into effect, then you have
            accepted the changes to these Terms.
